Genetic Algorithms

This program utilizes a genetic algorithm in an attempt to solve the knapsack
problem. It uses single point cross over and each genotype has a 10% chance
of a single mutation. Each genotype can be mutated at most once every
generation. Population size is set at 1000.

Knapsack Problem-
There are multiple items with values and weights. You can put any number of
items in the knapsack as long as it is under the maximum weight. The problem
is to attain the highest value while staying under the maximum weight.

GA.py - The program that runs the genetic algorithm. Written in python
sol.txt - An example output of the genetic algorithm running.
